## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

Your challenge, if you wish to accept it (and we sure hope you will), is to optimize this online portfolio for speed! In particular, optimize the critical rendering path and make this page render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques you've picked up in the [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884).

# Optimizations
- replace document.querySelector with faster document.getElementById and document.getElementsByClassName
- moved reusable calculations outside of loops
- combined multiple loops where possible
- decreased size of images to maximum display size
- loaded css inline

# How to run this application?

1. Download the project assets ( https://github.com/nestedcondition/P4 ).
